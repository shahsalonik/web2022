These are just some notes that I took based on the inital days of web.

- if you're adding a new template (into views) or modifying index.js in any capacity, always make sure to restart the server.

steps to push to git:
- intialize the repo (only the first time)

- add the files you modified using git add . (ONLY DO git add . IF YOU'RE IN /public !!! IF YOU'RE NOT, THEN cd public/ FIRST!!!)
- run git commit -m "your message"
- push to remote using git push origin main (NOTE: the remote branch isn't master--it's main)

general convention:
- css files are usually put into the static_files directory because nothing ever changes (unless it's the username, in which case you can populate it using handlebars notation)
